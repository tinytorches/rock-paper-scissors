# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the first JavaScript project I'm tackling as I learn web development through The Odin Project. This project will be a simple implementation of the grade-school classic "rock paper scissors". For the moment the game will be played from the browser console, but a front-end can potentially be built later down the road.

## Thoughts and Motivation

To be honest, I've been struggling to get a good grasp of JavaScript. In the end, I figured it's best to attempt and solve this project, while troubleshooting along the way instead of trying to learn "everything" I can about the language to be in a false sense of comfort before taking it on. There's more learning that comes along and stick when you try to solve problems... right?
